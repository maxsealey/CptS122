# CptS122-Labs-Assignments
Took Cpt_S 121 and 122 at Washington State University (Fall 2016 to Spring 2017). 
Took a hiatus from coding for a few years after, uploading some of the old labs and projects that I was able to find (some have been deleted by accident). 
Will likely use as jumping off point in reteaching myself C++ down the line.
